## React animation perf

Trying not using GSAP/d3 in combination with React and storing animations within state as `setState` gets a bit rinsed and can lead to reconciliation issues/slow framerates. Current preferred method is to bypass React lifecycle methods and to animate using `refs` and update elements manually.

Talking about looking into creating a lib similar to `react-canvas` that would allow a component to return SVG elements that don't get rendered into the DOM and get rendered into a canvas each frame (possibly through imagedata and <canvas> drawImage)
